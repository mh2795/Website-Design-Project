## Description

The goal of this project was to curate an elementary mockup of a website build in an effort to experiment with responsiveness while viewing the site from variously sized devices ( ex; iPhone, iPad, Desktop). In addition, the process of replicating the website template from a pdf format was helping in becoming more familiar with utilizing HTML & CSS with no external support or reference.
